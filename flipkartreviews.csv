1,"Good morning.
It is a nice product.
I used it for a day, and it is strong and muscular. Works just as a Bugatti but looks a bit like an Audi .
You can go for it if budget below 45000.
Backlit keyboard is also strong and useful.
Fingerprint scanner is fast and powerful.

So go for it. But do a bit research befor buying .

Thankyou.",5

6,It's best value for money laptop. Don't think about HP i3 11th because after 1 year HP will be slow definitely but not Vivobook. Battery is very good. Performance is awesome.

Display 5/5
Processor Speed 5/5
Design. 5/5
This is best product for students and some light work .speed is very due to SSD ram , it open in about 3 to 5 sec
Video quality is also good ( helpful for video lessons )

Pros:

Awesome Performance: The laptop can play any AAA title very easily. I have played GPU intensive games like Battlefield 5, Battlefield 1, Call of Duty Warzone etc. and didn't face any issue. The provided10th generation Intel i5 processor is of Hexa-cores. In games like Valorant, I am receiving 200-250 FPS in Medium Settings and 100-120 in Max Settings. The NVIDIA 1660-ti is still a really good buy and way better than 1650.

the only problem this laptop has is a thermal issue. it has intel 1Oth gen CPU so you can't undervolted it from XTU but you can do that from bios. changing thermal paste(Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut recommended) also reduces CPU temp quite significantly.

My recommendation is don't go for Realme Narzo 20a, cause the 32 gb fills up immediately and the realme ui is also not as polished as MIUI. You can choose between this and Poco C3.",4

So if you dont do much of work and if you want it for your parents then its good ,but if you are a student then you can try some other option ...",3
1865,To be completely honest this is not the best phone out there because there's always a bigger fish but this is the most okay-ish phone in my opinion but i'll give it 5 stars anyway because it works great. It lacks front camera quality and fingerprint sensor but I don't take any pictures and I don't need perfect security anyway. All I need is good performance and it's working fine after a couple of months. Totally worth your money.👌👌👌,5

1915,"On this budget it is worthy to buy this phone. I have received this phone 3 days back. Too early to give detailed analysis but, so far, I am satisfied. My previous Redmi 7A was also excellent and being a Xiaomi product I am confident that this will prove the same way.",5
1916,To give a proper review I used the product for almost a week now. The Camera and its features are good but can't be compared with high resolution Camera phone. The speed of its processor is satisfying. The screen resolution is okay. The best thing is the screen width. Very big screen which is good and useful in many ways. Overall I am quite satisfied. I would recommend it as a low budget phone in this market.,4

However , all other features are pretty good at this price point . The battery lasts for long hours, the display is decent, the phone does not hang at all, mi ui is becoming more and more polished as the days pass by. Overall great buy at this price point if camera is not a deciding factor for you. Otherwise...",4

The battery is surely awesome, it has nice 2 days standby and can work for about 10-12 hours for continuously. Mi services are of course up to mark. It's an wonderful phone under 10,000.",5

1940,Guyz plzz dont buy this..mobile if u are looking for good game performance.because gyroscope is not work properly u cant play any game tilt is so delay..,1
1941,I am using REDMI note 7 pro. This 9 Prime model is taken for my wife. I have found two negatives in this when compared with note 7 pro. Camera is not so good but average only. Display also a little bit dull. The display is good in my note 7 pro. But this model's display is not so good with lack of contrast. I tried all the settings related to display but no use. We can increase brightness but it is missing sufficient contrast. I don't say the battery and performance are excellent but quite OK.,3
1942,"Good for normal usage, display can be better, soo much bad display for outdoor usage, battery performance average but can be better, Need to soo much work in camera, camera is only good for outdoor, design is good feel good in hand, color design is also good looks good while holding in hand.. My opinion is if you have little bit more money you should go with other phones",4

2354,To be completely honest this is not the best phone out there because there's always a bigger fish but this is the most okay-ish phone in my opinion but i'll give it 5 stars anyway because it works great. It lacks front camera quality and fingerprint sensor but I don't take any pictures and I don't need perfect security anyway. All I need is good performance and it's working fine after a couple of months. Totally worth your money.👌👌👌,5
2355,Mi 9i is good no loss it is very good mobile any one can take this it's very good I am happy thank you,5
2356,"Nice mobile, good battery backup, camera satisfactory, display is awesome, sound quality satisfactory, nice internet speed. Best mobile at this range. Highly recommended",5
2357,"I've bought this for my parents, overall phone is good. But Redmi has used one camera, atleast they should have used a decent one but no, the camera is below average. My 2 year old Redmi 6 has better camera then this otherwise performance is good. My recommendation is don't go for Realme Narzo 20a, cause the 32 gb fills up immediately and the realme ui is also not as polished as MIUI. You can choose between this and Poco C3.",4

2364,"After MIUI V12.0.7.0 update performance is good but camera is very worse in low light only because it's software is not well optimising after clicking image.

Pros.
1. Side mounted finger senser, it works well.
2. Battery backup is good, easily lasts for a day.
3. Fast charging, works well
Cons.
1. Biggest one is camera, its pretty ordinary, I will never believe in their Megapixels value, its not at all 48MP.
INFACT, its barely 8MP. AI is also not so good.
Front Cam is even worst, Its like a 2MP camera from some branded phone.
I dont know why are they putting these many Cameras on the back

I needed a budge...",3

2383,"Cons:
Missing image stabilization:
since no in built optical image stabilization, not recommended for video recording, this is a huge flaw in the low price phones.

Processor is great but not too great:
MediaTek Helio G85 is just a great processor since you will see some minute lags here & there occasionally which can be overlooked but bit annoying.

Speakers are the worst (nightmare):

I procured POCO M3 Phone,But this phone is not good according to it's price . Camera quality is very bad and Battery Heating issue during gaming. Please don't buy this phone through flipkart.

Before starting let me be clear, THIS DEVICE IS NOT FOR SERIOUS MUSIC LOVERS/AUDIOPHILES.

I'm not gonna repeat the same technical aspects of it, you already know what's inside it. So...

Coming to the sound, if you just love some BASS and heavy sounds this earphone will become your best buddy in no time. The volume on this is insane. I only use it at 20-30% max. It's very loud. So no complaints there.

If you've used some premium earphone from brands lik...",4
3213,"Good product. Never used bluetooth headset before. Now I am happy to see ease in my work. As I noticed boat marketing their products aggressively in market in recent days. About product it's like awesome having better build quality, bass is good, battery backup is fine and vibration though it vibrates my neck when ever I gets call but still feature is must needed when u are driving. Wanted to give 5star but there is a sentence that "" Nothing is perfect in this imperfect world"" 😄😄😉",5
3214,First of all the Delivery boy is a good guy. Nice receive and responce. Product is super. Packing also good. I fell Red color is not sufficient for me. Otherwise totally awesome product. Delivery is too long. Iam taking one week after booking. Thankyou flipcart and boat 235v2 also.,4

Well this is called, quality engineering. Well, some people say Boat enhances bass and thus compensates with clarity, but I would give my neutral and true feedback
Bass : 10/10
Clarity : 9/10
Comfort ease n looks : 15/10
Features :10/10

The best buy from flipkart yet..",5

3219,Very great product at this price I will assure that this is a value for money product and the bass and sound quality was awesome the build quality was great 👌 and this product has a mat finish which gives a class and flagship look this is the best and the fast charging technology was working very well and the ear are fixing suitable in our ear the music quality was great,5
3220,"This headphone is good but not that much as i expected
*Pros- 1Good battery backup
2Good sound quality

*Cons-1 There's a voice gap between video activity and voice. Voice comes after video activity not both comes together. It is ok when you watch movies and music but if you play pubg with it you will clearly feel the big gap it matters a lot for me. It is not working after 4 month very much disappointed

Overall not good

3604,"So I have been using these for about a month now. The battery backup is good which usually lasts 8 to 9 hours. But you can't actually use once it reaches 20 percent. It starts annoying you with 'battery low' message every 20 seconds or so. They could have set the annoying threshold to 5 percent. And driving on 2 wheelers with these is a nightmare. It flies away if you drive fast even while not using it with the magnetic earbuds connected. Sound and bass is good considering its price (899)
The...",4

But if you are going for this to play games then you must not. It gets a sound delay.

1. Battery backup is off the charts. They say 8 hours and they give it.
2.Quick charge. I've never charged it for more than 30 minutes and it stays live whole day.
3. Sound quality is good, not the best.
4. Latency is there. So if you're planning to play online games like COD Or PUBG it'll get you killed. Expect a minimum 1 second delay.
5. Phone calls won't be private anymore, you'll need to speak louder than usual in order to make conversations ...",5

Cons. Highs n treble bit on d average side.

Anybody who is on a budget of less than 1000 rs. N looking a bluetooth option can surely opt for it.",4

Sound distortion is just too much. Doesn't sound like a branded headphones. Most likely the company is importing cheap stuff from China and selling it under its brand name.

Apart from horrible sound quality, these aren't comfortable on the ears. After using these i wouldn't trust Boat for any product....",1

6664,I purchased after 1 week ago and it's my personal opinion this 450 is good but sound quality is OK but Bass is superb and Build Quality Nice premium Quality Overall this headphone is Good and You want to go good bass than you go 450 otherwise you go other headphone But compare to jbi and 400 rockers more than good 450 but 510 is superb.. Because 510 rockerz Is good sound and bass and You will listen song of 510 than you won't pain 3 hours regular and 450 you will use 2 hours regular than you ...,5

Overall 3.8/5",4
6678,Sound quality was good battery backup I am not impressed with but it's not bad it's decent but what I don't like is it's not comfortable ears actually starting paining in the 15mins after you put the on the cushion is definitely a good one but the size of the cushion pad is the reason of this aching only if the size of the pad is a better it was a perfect💯 product and boat rockerz 510 is that perfect one,3
6679,Best one I gifted this to my bestie and he loved this soo much... 1 day delivery 😊😊😊😊😊tq,5
6680,"Good product in this price range

Minor con is it is little tight and i get uncomfortable using it for longer period.",4
6681,"Perfectly comfortable
Design is too good
Sound is high level
Better sound quality with aux cable ,bluetooth lowers quality sound these thing disappointed

6685,"Good product.
Battery life i got around 3days.
With full charging and half volume works for more than 14hr.

Bad the plastic looks cheep.i build is average not too notch.And the extension of ear cup is short .if you have a average head size it will fit.but sound is great and a nice range of Bluetooth4.1

Overall great if got it under 1100.
In sales you can get it at 999.
I bought it in sale for 1099....",5
6686,It is really good but bass is not good as 400 model but the build is really good and very comfortable to hear.,5

6688,Very good product awesome bass and sound quality..I'll say that the experience is better when you connect with Bluetooth rather than the aux cable..not much difference but still it's little better with Bluetooth...overall very good product..,5

6692,"Pros:
1) good battery backup
2) comfort to adjust

Cons:
1) air leaks outside and doesn't covered fully like boat rockers 400. For bass and sound comparing with boat rockers 400, boat rockers 400 is much better.
2) leather quality is not good.
3) ear gets pain while increase the volume
4) sound quality is not clear like rockers 400.
5) sometimes connection problem will be there.

And important thing is boat boom headsets will not come for life time max 2yrs only. And it doesn't have sweat p...",3

6696,It looks like premium. The sound quality is also awesome and bass is nothing to say as it is best for normal usage. It's normally doesn't lag during gameplay(pubg and freefire). But one thing I was disappointed was it is little bit tight so after 1 to 2 hrs u have to open your headphone for rest. And also remember it brings with Bluetooth 5.0 which gives a very much wireless connection. And the battery backup is fantastic .It gives about 9 to 10 hrs of battery back which is awesome but i...,4
6697,"Quite good from other headphones .
Bass ans sound are also good , the packaging too was very well and I am satisfied by the product",5
6698,"Very good headphones with a great built quality and design but I'm not so impressed with its bass. Bass is a bit low but sound quality is okay. So, if u r a person who doesn't give great importance to bass, u can buy it. Otherwise don't buy it go for zeb Duke.",4
6699,I am satisfied with this product...and delivery is within one day very happy with this and just go for it these are really nice,5
6700,"If you are looking for a good headphones for any purpose (specially gaming) under this budget range of 1000-2000 then I am assuring you that no option is available better than boAt Rockerz 450. Best value for money with an awesome and humongous battery life
and best sound quality (not on calling) AUX cable support make it more value for money . You will say that boAt Rockerz 510 is also there for the competition but I used that too and there is nothing extra about that. The sound quality is ...",5
6701,"I already use baot headphone but this one is better than that, awesome look and sound quality is very good, mike working clear sound for calling an lastdial make its perfect.such a good product in this range. Value of money.I love this product.",5

6704,If you like to listen romantic or smooth songs than it is a very good choice......it is not for high bass users,4
6705,"These headphones are better than rockerz 400,
Bt if ur buying these headphones for pubg then don't buy it rather than u should buy wired headphones,
Because u will not be able to hear the exact directions of footsteps or gunshots because of its heavy bass (with or without the aux cable ?)
Vocals are not that clear bt overall sound quality is good to hear",3
6706,"over all good headphone but i face two problems
1):- can't use for too long simultaneously because it starts feeling uncomfortable on ear
2):- personally i don't found it useful for PUBG .... it is only make you understand that enemy is on your left or right ..... but can't figure out from where sound is coming in game.
Music and movie experience is superb",4
6707,Best product ever.it's been a year since I've been using it and still it is top notch.it's the best headphone in this price segment. Moreover you should prefer to buy it instead of boat rokerz 400.,5
6708,Sound quality not good ... sound drivers don’t produce good quality bass and treble.... I have bluedio turbine which is far better than any under 2000,2
6709,"Overall sound quality is great but the build quality is so poor. Mine just got snapped in half after 3 months and same was the case with my brother who bought the same headphones moreover the battery backup is not actually 15 hrs at 80% volume, it's about 7-8 hours which is still good but it's not 15 like they claim. I suggest you to go for other headphones which have great building quality. Not satisfied at all.",3
6710,In the box its written 15hrs battery backup but it only works for near about 8 to 9 hrs max to max and it is not suitable for the ears. It presses the head from the sides you can't wear for more than 2 hrs and I trust and expect more from boAt....,3

My first over the ear headset & don't regret buying decision of BoAt. It's nice headset with good sound quality. Bass is also good. Only problem is you can't use it for long duration, it starts itching to ear & sweating. Mic needs improvement as calling is not that great with this.

The drivers definitely produce a very balanced sound that is surely going to satisfy most of the people including me. Whether it's about mid frequencies, vocals or the high frequency trebles, or even the lower frequencies, this neckband deals all of those with superior performance. Undoubtedly.

2. Sound quality is also not good as per rate",1
7119,truly i am not at all satisfied with this product... its speed is too slow... as it comes with older bluetooth version 4.1... i will recommend u guys dont go for it... if u want to get well satisfied then go for new versions one... or other options is jbl... price will comes easily under the new version one... i already gave my reviews now its yours turn to choose the right one... thank u,1
7120,Bass is good but not as good as what you expect. streaming source will decide the quality of sound. Gaana and wynk I didn't find that exceptional audio. but it is decent when played via YouTube and Netflix. just one day use. will update details very soon.,2
7121,If u r buying it just for phone calls then it's ok but if u r looking for music or games. Don't buy it. Sound quality is just quiet ordinary. Battery back up is decent. Price is high as per quality standards. Needs improvement in sound quality or reduction in price.,2
7122,Red color is good as thought but not satisfied with it becz while hearing the music it will be start brking the tune sounds base is good battery backup oly for one day if office purpuse not suitable and for normal use it's good can't hear 6hrs music back to back oly for 3hrs last depends upon how to keep it will be like that.,4

I don't like the ear tips, it not that comfort for long time and when we take calls, it not clear in out door.",4
7127,"Best wireless earphone under 1k.
Bass is damm awesome.
Design is almost good but wire is a little bit small.
If you buy for listening bass boosted audios then good otherwise you have to use an equalizer if you listen to mood calming music as the clarity of sound would lack because of bass.
You can't play PUBG or any shooting or battle royal games as there is time delay which can get you killed before you get aware of enemies.",5
7128,"What to say about the product,very much satisfied with the sound quality and the bass,bass is also good but not comparable with the wired one.Connnectivity is good but could be improved but the back up time is fabulous.Overall a very good product in this range",4
7129,"To be honest, I bought this for someone else. I must say, I am amazed by the crispness of sound. The tone and vocals are quite good, however about this extra bass, I don't know how much this helps, but I dont think it adds to the beauty of music. The voice cracks at full volume due to the extra bass. Also, about the sweat and water proof feature, I used it once or twice in the gym. Works fine, since I sweat a lot. Well, battery backup is beyond expectation. Plays for 5ish at a stretch. Saw tw...",4

Firstly the cons
LAG WHEN USED IN TV
I think these sometimes lag with the TV, either it's because of the distance between the TV and the user or however. There's seemingly some small lag u notice in using these headphones.
At other times this seems very minimal and is ok to have been using with TV.

Good sound and bass. Good product. U can see the advantages and it's features up.

1) It's microphone is not that good

7311,"I am using this headset for 9 months, till now it's working perfectly, no sound quality problem or battery draining problem, it works continuously for more than 12hrs after a full charge. This is the best headset I ever used. I used several headset of several brands like jbl, MI, boat bassheads 225, Philip's, Samsung, Sony etc. In all these headsets, this one is best for travelling and calling. One of The best quality i love in this headset is sound and mic quality while riding bike. I used t...",5
7312,The earphone quality is wonderful and initially I was quite hesitant to purchase it but I have used it for a month like and its quality is create the sound quality is good but the build quality is not that much great and the microphone quality is decent the fitting in my ear is quite good when the attachment is removed it tends to fall sometime but overall a must buy product under1k,5
7313,"Good Sound
Bass is awesome
Connectivity is good
Battery backup sufficient
Cons:
Design is very poor
You can't use it while riding bike
Specially when wind is there it will not fit around the neck",3
7314,"Excellent sound, excellent bass. Good for music and VOIP calls like skype & MS Teams. Batter backup on-call is not that great you will not be able to use for full 8 hours shift you will have to charge if on breaks but it charge fast.",4
7315,I have been using it for 7 months .and I'm satisfied until now.. bass and sound clarity is just awesome ..,4

7323,It’s really awesome it expected it’s not better but my review is excellent I recommend to do buy it because it is better than other brands,5
7324,Using for a week. Battery back up is good. Sweat resistance is also good and sound quality is best but only for high bass lovers. Volume may feel a little low at first but you'll probably get adjusted to it with time. Overall a great product got it for 999.,5
7325,"Boat Rockerz 255F Bluetooth Headset sounds quality is good and bass is too good battery backup is also good I love this product ❤️🤙


THANKS FOR BOAT",5
7326,"Nice headset for this price( 1099).And Brand also extremely good, i loved it.
But here I would like to share the things which i came to know while using, I Don't know if anybody noticed that using this Bluetooth headset we can't connect to the Radio even though we connect the Bluetooth to the phone also it is asking to insert the earphone so it's better when Bluetooth also works to Radio and it's very helpfull to the people who listen Radio.",5
7327,Woww.... amazing product thank u Flipkart for the amazing product I'm very happy to deal with this...also fast delivery aspect of the day..wow .,5
7328,"Some key features to take look on-

1. They indeed are bassheads, as when I plug in I totally get lost in music. Music quality is wonderful, bass powerful headphones.

2. They have a unique feature of connecting with two Bluetooth devices simultaneously.
I don't particularly know in what ways it would help, as it happened to me like 3 time when i have connected it with my phone and my dads phone Bluetooth is always on because of the arogya app so it automatically connect with that phone and...",4
7329,Good and it lasts for 5 hours straight and fast charging..I've purchased it for 1014 rs ..fast delivery tho .. I'm happy,4

It is also good in running.
I love this product.
I suggest everyone to buy this Bluetooth earphone in this budget.
U will surely like it.
I didn't receive",4
7331,True to the description. Works perfectly fine. Well it's not cheap. So it better work fine. No complains.,5
7332,"Nice colour and als a good product as in terms of pric and quality
Boat is always been relianle for me..
Mic is good and also the sound is peasnt mot krinky",4
7333,Excellent product for the price. Good sound at this quality. Looks good too. Battery life is also good. Much Better than infinity at this price,5
7334,"Not so good for gaming. Only bass is high. Even on calls the person cant hear us clearly. I used poltronics wireless earphones before this, that was good in clarity of sound. This one is uncomfortable too in ears. Not so good product.",3
7335,"Superb Awesome and got what I expected...
sound is crystal clear as background voice as well audible well.. happy",5
7336,Genuine good product Sold by CORSECA .... fabulous ... Most impressed with smooth switching between Laptop and Mobile at the same time .. very handy while con-calls on laptop and voice calls on Mobile..... bass is bit messy affecting clarity of Mid tones (even though I m a huge Bass lover) .. but it’s tolerable as compensated by other features ..good battery life ... range is ok for open space or without any wall in between ... neckband is not firm around the neck in T-Shirts during workout...,5
7337,"It's a way better than the other earphones and the most loving part is its bass, it's too good in the price range of 999.",4
7338,Impressed by the look. Impressed by the awesome sound. Impressed by the soft ear buds and the instant voice control blue tooth connectivity. In one word excellent choice and thanks flipkart. Now it is neighbours envy owners pride.,5
7339,Comfortable earphones and are tough enough for a workout and heavy duty running. Would have loved for a better battery backup as the one advertised here is simply not true. The bass is good enough but midtones feel flat. Buy them if you’re into edm or mostly listen to podcasts. Won’t suggest them for other genres though.,5
7340,Good sound quality & calling mic so amazing smooth and clear sound quality,5
7341,"Yaa...it's good now only I recieved and I hear it sound and base quality , earing sense , design and building is super and it's more reliable and elastic so no problem I recommend to everyone buy this product awesome product",5
7342,Such a good product I luved it. Bass and music are very good 👍 worth for price,5
7343,Sound and clarity is great in this earphone. Bluetooth connects fast and connectivity is really good. Good noise cancellation. Battery backup alone can be improved (considering the price of the earphone) though it gives the backup of around 5 hours talk time.,4
7344,Nice product... thanx flipkart. Thank you so much for fast delivery... or the delivery boy was too good... very helpful thanx both of you,5

If you have decided to buy this product somewhere around 1k, I guarantee you that the product is worth it. More than that would be a little expensive.

Design is also pretty good and sturdy. If you use it for longer duration then you may feel a little bit of pain at first but you will get used to it.

Mine just went silent on one side after 8 months",3
7392,I have been using these earphones since Nov-2019. I am kind of addicted to it. Great sound quality with enough bass level. Build quality is also good but not premium (you cannot argue as these are budget earphones). The connectivity range is also moderate. Battery life is sufficient. I use these earphones for almost entire days. I take about 15 - 20 phone calls (10 - 12 minutes each) and listen to music for about 3.5 - 4 hours and battery last for almost entire day.,5
7393,Awesome headset by the boat company better than other headset this little bit costly I think so on this range of the quality and the ear supporter should be much hard and this is gone iattring little bit and other wise this is awesome product.,4

BUILD and DESIGN
The build quality is bad. Those wires are really thin. And within this 6 month period BOTH SIDES STOPPED playing and i had to fix em by cutting out the bad portion of the wire and rejoining.
Also the paint on the ear pieces came off.

Also, the earphones keep dangling way too low, almost touching...",3

But neglecting the microphone, this headset is just awesome. Worth the price. Because of its design, the buds fit in the ear perfectly. They won't come out of the ear even during jogging, running or jumping. The sound quality is awesome. Perfect headset to hear folk songs. Bass boost is very good. It is light weight and flexible.

It was of very very cute and awesome sound. But this boAt is not upto it's level in clarity.

But I don't know why I'm facing problem like repeatedly disconnected , and sometimes even if connected have to talk through mobile speaker. Disconnected automatically even if in use, even when you just hand call and gets ditached. Battery is average, 6 hours, charging is fast. For 900 its good but not at 1500 plus",4
7444,Superb build quality with super bass effect clear audio even when call quality is too gud and I buy RS.999 in offer it's worth for money.,5
7445,Hi Everyone..I am using this earphone since last 15 days.Good sound for those for who likes bass more ove balance sound quality..Battery back up also good last upto 3-4 days for average user like me.,4
7446,"Good quality product, handy, compatible, as usual boat serves very good quality sound in this range.....I purchased this one @ rs 1500. Same product is available on club factory in the range of 1000 but don't know about the quality from this site.",4
7447,"I purchased it 6months ago, it's Good product I liked it but battery backup is not promising.
Bass is Good but not that great as other wired boat earphone's",3
7448,"Ordered this beauty on big billion sales day, it's already been a year using this no issues. I got it @900 worth at that price, fantastic audio output, easy controls, wire is good, build quality is great. If someone is looking to buy BT earphones with great Audi output just go ahead and i also use bose bt earphones that isn't great. I am totally satisfied with the Audio output and also it has noise cancellation.",4
7449,"It's the best one , best for sound with awesome bass and having Google assistant which help me to call while driving.

This could be the best choice better than mivi",5
7450,The best brand and quality you can get at this price. Highly recommend if you listen clear music with normal bass.,5
7451,"Overall rockerz is Rocked
Sound quality is awsm
Bass lovers just go for it it's brilliant u will love it
Batery is good

Its demerit is bass is so high u cant hear properly background instruments like guitar , violin which hardly u hear
But i love this product
Its worthy",5
7452,"Very nice product....After using 6 months..I m commenting...Pls go for it .

Isse jyada range wale or bhi companies k aate hai..But trust me un mai bhi itna acha feel nahi hoga.... Best",5
7453,"good. bought for 1299 RS. but feels like keep on charging it. they said 6 hours battery life, but in box slip it mentioned like 5 hours of battery life. I feel it comes only for Max 4 hours if you are in video call. not more than that. They could have given a clip to hold it on shirt collar, magnet is not that much powerful, it unbinds very easily, tough to handle it while riding bike",3
7454,"Nice & worth for pricing, I gave it to my brother as a gift & he is very happy",4
7455,this product is best than the other things it have a great sound and great bass and its design also awesome because of it is flexible ...and battery backup is not bad..,5

7479,The bass sound is really good. If you are base lover you'll love this. But there is little noise in the background while listening. Battery backup is good for one day.

I got these for 1k only....
you might get for 1.4 or 1.5k also...

anything is awesome but you wanna premium wireless earphones then just go for realme ones...they are far far better than that.....",5
7521,"For the price range of 1k to 1.8k these Bluetooth headset are absolutely the best one out there. For an audiophile anything below Beats-Bose-Sennheiser-Sony(all 10-15k & above)is waste.

Bass(7/10), Clarity of sound(8/10), Bass-Treble balance(9/10), Comfort (9/10), Design (7/10), Battery Backup(9/10). Here 7-Good, 8-Satisfying, 9- Best (for this range, respectively).",4

7531,"sound is good , if you love high base then its for you.. i was expecting for BT 5.0..
and also if you use it while riding then it might will fall on the way while overspeeding.. keep it under caller and also i won't recommend it for high gyming..",4
7532,"overall it is a nice product but it could be a better one. if we compare it with mivi thunder beat, both of these have some drawbacks. sound quality of mivi is very good but base is not that great. boat have a lot of base but its sound quality is not that great. its comfortable to carry it fits well, it is light weight. on the other hand mivi is a little bit heavier and your ears will start paining if used for long. overall i can say under 1000 both of these are good.",4

7561,This is the best earphones under 1500 rs segment although it could be better if they provide latest Bluetooth 5.0 with longer battery and the highlight of this product is superb bass... Far far better than mivi brand,5
7562,Bluetooth is not fully compatible with MI Phone and sound quality gets lost in between due to the extra bass - it gives out extra base even when there is no or very little base in the song. Not good for listening songs where the melody is more important than drums. Design is good but you can't change songs using mounted controls thats very Disappointing.,3

Then after searching for a long time this was the best in budget so this time i bought in flipkart. The sound quality was amazing for a Bluetooth headset. Its not a sony or any thing but for 1K you can't ask for more. BASS is awesome if the ...,5
7568,"first of all I bought this on regard of recommendation from my from I tested it and liked it
the music quality 5/5
bass is the main attraction and the reason I bought this neckband it takes you to a whole new level 5/5
next is build quality it's nice and well build but ear hurts a little bit after 2 hrs of continuos use well not a problem in my case so 4/5
value for money in big billion sales you get this at a rate of 899/-
on normal rate it is 1399/- well yeah it has value for money 4/5",5
7569,Nice Bluetooth comes under best price. Sound clarity is good but bass is so high. Battery backup is less. very comfortable. Value for money product.,4
7570,"Good sound quality with perfect bass, but not Comfortable with helmet.. Also call quality is very poor, most of the time except your people can listen all other background sound..",3
7571,Nice product and sound quality I liked so much good comfort,5
7572,Branded one which give awesome experience. Sound clarity is okay but when compared to Boult it is less. Design is Perfect and Battery is okay for a day. It will be more fine if the earbud is curved so that it can avoid falling often.,4
7573,product was good when I bought it. it was so good to hear music on it. but now I am not able to hear properly on right side earphone. I bought it only a month ago. and the sound quality is decreasing day by day... not sure whether I received wrong product or this product is always the same,3

it comes with a nice neck band which is very comfortable and it's also sweat proof
the bass is very good
the fitting and all is all good fits right in the ears

cons
we better watch out for the water because if the water is absorbed by the headphones then it's gone
and battery can be improved a little bit
keep it away from fire cause the battery can be damaged


over all a nice product and very handy use",5

7586,"The headohone is decent enough for this price range (999) and you can expect well D2D usage. Battery does need charging, and also volume on headset seems somewhat low. The Next/Previous track button working is cumbersome. All in all good for this price",4
7587,Great product at a good price! Amazing sound and good build quality.,5
7588,"sound level is not that best like 600. Bass is not up to the mark. Overall built is good. look is satisfactory. In total, a good item that is worth keeping.",3

7686,this is a very good product best sound best Bess. best bettry pick up,5
7687,Good value for money. Been using this headset for a month now and I am loving it. The only complain I have is about the battery life and build. The battery dies a bit early and the headset loosens while you’re running. Else everything is perfect. The sound quality is better then I was expecting. Bass is great. No complaints in that department. Overall it’s a great buy. WORTH EVERY PENNY!,4
7688,"good product, good sound quality recommended to music lovers, I got one JBL T160BT as a gift, very worst in bass effect, I have raised return request to that TF JBL head set, that technician came and simply he is telling this product is has this much only a bass quality and he is telling why you have not checked review before purchasing this product like.

this is far better then mivi collar I didn't compare it with mivi thunder beast but with mivi collar ,boat is winner
base is superb , easily fits in ear ,,built quality is best ,six hour battery life is less but for sound quality I neglect it",4

7699,"Packaging was perfect. Delivery was timely. The product is of good robust quality and the sound is very nice. Charging points are easy, earbuds are functional, once you are used to the design, you could even let it stay unused around the neck without using and would not feel its weight.

Lasts 4-5hr max, bass is good but not comparable to boat basshead 220 or 225, clarity is okay, u sacrifice few things to get few things its as simple as that, overall a good package, considering the pricing it seems bit high it should be sold around 1k only not worth the 1500rs mark. U have plenty of other options u can go for, but if u are looking for bluetooth eaphones with heavy bass in 1500 then go for it.",4

Comparing with JBL, the feel of the song is not as good as JBL, however its good considering the price. This is because of Bass which is pretty heavy in my liking, JBL bass is way more soothing to ears. So I usually keep songs at low level as the bass make me uncomfortable to listen to song for more than 30 mins.

Regarding ear ...",5

You can also watch movies with this little guy in full HD sound! This is incredible...",5

But after used i really shocked this Performance. because i enjoyed every instrument sounds in while listing songs. but i never get that experience this product. its only give just Average Bass and below average Clarity. and it's very comfortable to calls also.

And if you want to balance the sound equalizers like Poweramp and other things would do good. Best partner for travel. convenient. Battery back up is more than 6 hrs. You can just play this from coimbatore to chennai with one charge. The only thing is , i could nt find any travel case for this.",5
7733,"Bought it for 809 rs in big billion days, No issues in battery backup which last of one and half day... Bass and sound quality is pretty decent .

These wireless earphones come in a good package and delivery was smooth.

I recommend this product to all user for this amount of investment. The only reason to give it is 4 that it's slight low sound in right one speaker.,4
7855,"I think it’s a great headphone with this price range. Im using this for a week now and I’m delighted by my purchase. The only thing that disappointed me though is the battery back ups of this headphone is bit on the lower side. This is ideal for short Travells and workouts . Those considering for a longer periods have to look for other products in the market. I’m externally happy with the sound out put from this device, specially the deep bass is absolutely mind blowing. Overall, happy with ...",4
7856,"Good quality audio experience. Bass medium, not like up to the heavy bass. But for moderate usage u can prefer it. Allover value for money.",5
7857,best wireless ear phones in that prize . i bought it for rs 999 in sale so in this prize range its best,4
7858,I am using this earphone from last one month. its amazing and value for money product. Sound quality is amazing at this range and also good battery backup.,4
7859,"not good not bad , got this at 999 at this price point it is good build is good but not comfortable . You have to get use to it , sound is not so good punchines is not there so if ur priority is sound then it is not a good option in my opinion but not bad alsooo",3
7860,"Build quality is poor. the part covering the charging point is so small that it's hard to open it. I can bet that part will tear off very soon. The wire is good but too long and no way to adjust it. The battery backup is as mentioned but other users told me it will go down to 3-4 hours within 6-7months of usage. In other hand the sound quality is great.. with some tuning you can also get a nice Bass out of it.. For those who prefer noise cancellation, this one does a nice job there.",3
7861,superb product but its battery % doesn't show properly but battery works properly,4
7862,"This is Excellent Product of boAt. Sound Quality , build quality are good.i bought this rockerz 255F at special price of 999 only. calling communications are also remarkably good.

7865,"when I was started leaning music it was giving best result but when I am playing pubg the audio was delay it's not for gamers only for lensing songs,movies and other and built quality is super magnetic earbuds was really fantastic built quality get 5 out of 5 rating and it has tow devices connect option if you%r real music lover is best at this cost but not for pubg lovers it war delay audio getting few sec late otherwise it was a good product at rs 899",3

7873,"Overall nice product at this price range. Sound quality in not so good as expected. At the full volume speakers starts breaching. Bluetooth range maximum 15 feet in open areas, range decreases if wall comes between. Battery percentage 100% to 80% takes 2hour. 80%-20% takes 3 hours. 20% to zero takes 10-20 minutes.
Tangled free wires are so strong. look wise it's cool.",4
7874,Great product with good quality of bass and made of bluetooth. Even putting into the year its awesome to listen the songs. Incoming call could be hear with clearly sound.,5

7886,"Good headphones got at 850/- during Big billion sale.
compared with boult n realme buds, it makes u more satisfactory. u can't find the bass as boat does.
but I'm not satisfied with this product. ofcourse we can't expect a home theatre effect in small things.
overall good at bass point of view.
Don't expect balanced sound from this product.
if u r a balanced sound lover go for wired earphones. they'll make u feel good than bluetooths.",4
7887,"This product is best in 999 .
sounds quality is good but not bed...nd Bess is sufficient for simple use nd bettery pickup is best _I used almost last two days alternatively after buy but till not low......",5

7891,good product works well design and the quality is really good ....,4
7892,"Sound quality means ""voice of the singer"" is little low but it's good,
remaining all are tooo good

Surrounding sounds means like Dolby Atmos is good
When we watch 8d vedios it's just like real time experience

At this price you shouldn't expect all",5

7896,"earphone is very good but packaging was not good , I think Flipkart should work on it , and I got late delivery , I don't expect Flipkart is doing this",3
7897,"I'm a user of Sony extra bass earphones. boat rockerz 255F is comparable to sony XB50 earphones. Boat is superior in grounds of phone call as it doesn't work upto the mark with sony xb50. I bought this as 999 and sony at 4600 a year back. For the price and features, I would rate 5 star for boat. I'm impressed.",5
7898,"it's pretty good,,, but the Bluetooth connection was poor..sound is good.. not so nice and not so bad... in this price it's good... bass also OK OK.. not so high not so less... go for it if u want a Bluetooth headset in low budget",4

7900,"I bought it for 900. for this range it's really awesome.
1)I was watching a series after charging it 100. % and the battery lasted more than 8 hours I was continously watching it while I was travelling.
2)calling also is fine. but if we are in a crowd then it is not that great.
3) sound quality is fine but if you are looking for good bass and all then this one is not your pick.
4) easy to connect to Bluetooth and the design is so good it's very confortable.",5
7901,awesome product great bass.if u are a bass lover go for it without second thought.treble is kindly off as bass is over shadowing it.vocals good and decent.very good for taking voice calls in any place .overall 4.3 rating product out of 5,5
7902,so so.. design is not so good and not so comfortable but overall this is a good product in 999.,4
7903,Built quality of headphone is quite good but it could be better but overall it's value for money. The sound quality of headphone is best in this segment. I suggest this for everyone.,4
7904,"This is better than boat 205 even extra length, better designed to fit in exactly as I expected. But doesn't give me more than 4 hrs back up time, very good for this price in.",5
7905,An above average but not excellent product for 1059 rs don't expect any think more after getting immediately I examined bluetooth connectivity is easy but 10meter range is not getting I measured the length in my big living room which is 22feet long and 10feet wide and to kitchen after 5 meters intureption faced crossing 6meter completely disconnected this is the only issue found so fa in ear fitting is excellent and comfortable feel like fethertouch no rough surfaces battery backup is very go...,4
7906,"Headphone is great at this price range, however the battery backup is not at all satisfying. I have used mi bluetooth which have 9+ hour of battery backup with great sound. I like both the headphones however boat need to work on battery backup of this device.",5
7907,"Super Awesome
Bought two of them
And works really fine
Really worth its price",5
7908,"A great product indeed , runs for more than what's been specified. A good thumping bass as clear as wired headsets. Yet another good headset from BoAt",5
7909,"firstly kudos to flipkart for their excellent delivery timing. The product received before time, amazing product at this price. great build quality, good music overall must buy product.",5

7913,"Awsome product , comfortable , battery back up is good. sound quality is quite good. you can do workout , it is water resistant. but not water proof. Overall if I say product os awasome. I got it at 999. Dont think about it. buy it.",5
7914,"awsome headphone at this price, voice clarity is too clear, valye for money design is also quite trending and it will feel like u have nothing in your ear like other headset it is not painfull i would really appreciate such product at such low price, battery back up is also very good",5

7918,"As usual, in time delivery by flipkart. Happy with the choice. Good sound quality, effective noise reduction. Good battery backup. Overall worth your money.",5
7919,very good product High fidelity bass treble good and battery also very nice,5
7920,"Awesome Sound quality.. only one suggestion for design team,to design ear piece more effective.After few time use,there is little bit of headache,don't know the reason but might b due to air trap.This type of earbuds isolate our sound &feel like ear get jammed.Strongly suggestion to improve earpiece design.overall good enough",3
7921,when i bought this it was awsome i mean its sound is amazing with battery packup but after using 1 month they were not working properly sometimes .,2
7922,"very high bass.
range is 10 feets.

heavy earpieces so pain in ears after long use.

if u like bass then buy boat 255f but if dknt like much bass then buy boat 235.

boat 235 has more battry life 8hrs buf less bass.
biat 255f has more bass less battry life but fast charging.",4
7923,"Its superb but not the best.. Bass works well but midtones , vocals are good but not high end .. If u love higher music volume please don't go to this .. Overall the product its above average but below High End ...",3
7924,nice one but when ever you are in a hourney ona bike you will get disurbance to talk a cal..and music is good .it is good to use in dj lights in yiur room with your friends with drink😜..love this bass..design quality means ear buds are not strong,4
7925,"The product is just wow!
It's a very awesome product. No doubt it has a great bass and to a great extent noise cancellation and decent sound clarity and mind-blowing battery but the following disappointed me though I tried a lot to adjust.

1. Bluetooth range not more than 10m
2. pain in ear due to the conical buds (can be removed)
3. Wires are a bit long which makes it odd in front
4. No pouch provided",4
7926,"Quality of earphone is really great but sound is good not best can be done better.

Build Quality 5/5 :- Build quality is really good & premium
Battery Backup 5/5 :- 8hrs of battery backup guaranteed
Sound 3/5 :- Sound can be improved, it is good but really needs to improve for earphones of this price
Bluetooth connectivity 4/5 :- Connectivity is nice vut bluetooth 4.1is provided, Bluetooth 5.0 must be given

Overall a must have earphone at this price of ?1000.",3
7927,Boat rockerz always rocks man. Awesome sound and awesome bass. Loving it. And also very happy with flipkart and their service.,5
7928,best product at this range . Bass is very good . sound clarity is crystal clear. best product by boat. didn't like the buttons provided. Could be better. over all awesome product.,5
7929,Awesum headset from boat i love to use it sound quality is very nice and super and battery backup is also good.,5
7930,bought it for 899. if you love more bass then it's perfect for u. Bluetooth range is very less. otherwise if you have budget constraint then go for it. it is the best in this range,4
7931,good clarity of sound. bass is just OK. bass lovers don't go for it. for conversations good. try to give good noice cancellation mic for phone conversations.,4
7932,"This is my second boat product and I am not disappointed at all. True that it's not like the expensive brands where you get the acoustic precise. But given the price range, the product is good. Could have done better with the chord from the neck to ear, you some time feel the pull from neck band. No problem with pairing. The additional ear plugs you get suits your need. Well it comes with its own charging chord so that's handy. Over all at the price point of 899 it was a great deal(this was...",5
7933,"The headset is simply amazing. Sound quality is very good, balanced and has good bass. Battery backup is excellent too. I could not find any cons. You should definitely go for it.",5
7934,The Sound Quality is Great but not the Best the bass is on Higher side ! battery backup is an Issue though comes 3.5 hours playback time could be enough for a Gym session ! Me Frankly from same BOAT we have 261 they are Excellent in All aspects,4
7935,"1. Sound quality is not good as compared to other earphones .
2. Battery backup is also less(4hrs)
3. Connectivity is also not good it get disconnected in less than 3mtrs.
4. Sound gets distorted when volume is increased to max level
At last I am not satisfied with the product as they say...
""PLUG IN TO NIRVANA"".
it doesn't suits them...",2

7938,As compared to price at 899 its as worthy product but we cant expect good sound quality from it. If need a good sound quality and battery backup and bass and quality of product one should go for realme wireless buds.,3
7939,everything is fine but don't have sound quality like JBL. if you are true music lover than may you won't enjoy as much.,3
7940,the earphones are good and built well. the downside is the microphone and battery. doesn't last long . it only lasts for about 4-5 hours. if u r looking for a phone for calls and battery this isn't the right choice for you. I see a lot of difference between my and my friends earphones . lucky mine is better :),4
7941,best quality thank you Flipkart and best sound quality and look is awesome,5
7942,Overall Boat rockerz 255f best but its bass is too high .. that the only reason i dont like because when i listen some soft music it sound is little poor becuase of its high bass . otherwise yu can buy it its battery backup is good and also it is sweat resistance so for Gymmers it's the best option for yu...,4
7943,"bass is good . But in pubg game the audio in not proper ( 2 sec k baad audio sunai deta he )

7949,"Awesome Product. Been using since 3 days.. Battery backup is around 5 hrs on continuous usage. Voice assistance is working properly. Charger Cable is good but rather small. Full charge in 1- 1n1/2 hour. Will post another review after a month of use.

Good bass, decent noise cancellation.
Good battery back up.

Magnet on the rear of the headpiece is a worthy mention.
So far works like a charm.

7956,Oct 2019. Sound quality is good.. I bought it for 999 in offer. Bass is good at this price. But range is not good u move away 5 feet from mobile and sound starts cracking and little further it will get disconnected.. Though it's a good buy at this price.,3

7958,Very nice and affordable at this price. Nice design and good sound quality and bass is also perfect in this price segment. Battery backup is also too good. Very nice wireless earphone in this range.,4
7959,It's really a rocker as they said. Sound clarity is awesome with great bass control. The only thing as a demerit was the material quality should be improved.,5

7965,it is very good product and I really enjoy it thanks flipkart team for setting and offer like this and I look forward to buy more products.,4
7966,"sound quality and price are good... able to connect to 2 device at a time is awesome feature. but two cons.

cons :
1. battery goes to 100% to 80% to 20% , 20% gives continuous alerts which makes it not usable... meaning battery status is kind of not so useful.

2. not designed to be used for longer periods. my ears start paining after almost 45 to 1 hour. may be uts metallic design and in ear design is the culprit. it should have a over the ear hook for better comfort.",4
7967,"I'm satisfied with every aspect.
I'm using it since 3 months probably and having no any issue.
The battery backup may not fully satisfy you.
At this price- obviously a great deal.",5
7968,Bass lovers will love it.. crisp and clear sound. definitely worth buying at this price,5
7969,"This Bluetooth device is so good that I can't think of anything else when it comes to my need of earplugs. Sound quality is impressive. It gives ear buds in 3 sizes, so you don't need to worry about the size of your ear. The most important part is that you don't have to pair it again and again like other devices because it connects automatically when you on your Bluetooth.",5
7970,"Seriously, I am happy. First thing first audio quality is super, m really liking the bass and the voice also doesn't lack clarity. The ergonomics are good, fits very well in the ear, great build quality , and yeah it has some kind of magnet on the earpieces that keeps it intact when you're not using it. :P. So summarizing it really is a good earphones to go for and a Big YES from my side,Kamsamida flipkart for the product and greta service as always.",4
7971,"best sound quality ,sound bass is extra laud ,bild quilty is good , awesome product thnx to Flipkart",3
7972,"Awesome bass. This one's for you if you like going to the gym with headphones on.
Calling is not that good though(mike isnt as good as samsung u flex)
still it is a value for money product",5
7973,not that premium n sound is not that great as wired earphones has better n clear sound like bote 100,4
7974,"Its a worth headset to every penny, nice sound, cool and light weight, pretty design and also easy to carry, go for it without any doubt",5
7975,super sound quality and comfort with super duper bass .Loved it and it worth every single penny of money.go for it😘😘,5
7976,I couldn't recommend you something better. I've packed my Samsung level u earphones and started using these. A big fan of the voice quality. 100 times better than Samsung. Got them for 999 in Big Billion Sale. Thank You Flipkart for this amazing offer on this product!,5
7977,"only for bass lovers nice battery backup sound clearity not so well as like senhiesser earphones
design is very nice and comfortable
it was a good purchase for 999 rupees only",4
7978,"battery backup is normal. sound quality is good in the price of 999rs. bass is not there. look is stylish. Good decent product in the price range of 999rs. I have been using it for 15 days from now, hope it turns out to be good n working fine in near future.",4
7979,OK..... so if you are looking for some simple treble and a very crisp audio it is not meant for you... these earphone provide immersive bass experience and if you love bass then these are surely for you... and the build quality is nice according to the price in which I got these (999rs) they are awesome as I was expecting... thank me later...,5
7980,good bass and good conectivy. But ear buts cable is too lenth and battery backup average 4 or 5 hours. Otherwise wise it's really worth for money. I bought offer time just 899.,4
7981,"Design
Design is comfortable wear can be used for workout, running etc and build quality is good. It has high volume and bass unlike wired the sound quality is best under 1000rs Bluetooth headset. The battery backup is satisfactory and u can go make it through the day. There is noise cancelliation and it also good to mask out the background noises",4
7982,"Build material is good, but wires are not bounded well. Sound it very good as well as battery life is fine. We can improve on wires winding as that should nit be at the tips.. Should use clips like Boult earphones do. But overall it's better.",4
7983,It's really good one.bass is well balance.in music voice is not so clear.over all performance is good.with or within1099 is good pricing range for this.,4
7984,"Wow realy fantastic headset , thanks boat rockers, super bass and sound clarify is too good, I really liked so much😍",5

7986,"Good product guys....

The product and the sound quality both are good..
After using it for almost 4 months my right side speaker stopped working .I went to the boat service center the gave a new product directly on the stop..

I tested it with
Mi Note 5 - didn't like sound quality.
Mi Note 5 Pro - same song and what a marvelous sound.
Sony Expria ZR - More bass than Mi Note 5 Pro, still something was missing in quality.
So I guess, sound quality also depends on your handset.",5

8014,Worth the money. Battery Backup is quite good. Being the heavy user my self I used to charge it for one time and it goes for around one complete day..despite of listening non stop music of 50 mins plus. Go for the product and don't give it a second though. If you are planning for realme earbud let me tell you it might be good compare to this but remember it has only 6 months warranty period and boat gives you 1 yr warranty period and since it is a electronic item warranty period matters a lot...,4

8118,Its awesome . Good sound quality . perfectly fit on ears (if you slightly adjust that extra fitting forward it become more fit).,5
8119,ya...for economical persons it is a good wireless ear phone and also it give 6 to 7 hour battery back up..but earbud need to improve other wise 1400 price range it's best..go for it,5

*Product outlook looks Good
*inside ear fixable option is very nice with this including comfortable.
FINALLY HAPPY WITH PRODUCT 💖",4
8127,"Its cool and good product , only thing i dont like that its sound quality could be better 😁",4
8128,i lyk...d quality of the product but as a bass lover i don't really like the sound dat much according to its prize i also have a wired earphone from the same brand and i lov dat but not these bluetooth anyways if ucr a music lover thn dun go for it...but if u r a caller who took lot's of calls thn go for it blindly,4
8129,"Nice earphones good sound quality if the neckband was done away, it would be more convenient to carry and also if the company would have provided the carry pouch would have been more better",5
8130,"The earphone built quality is good and seems durable. I personally found bass on high side than normal and it gives headache on prolonged use. The voice quality is not very satisfactory on calls and the worse is battery suddenly drop down to zero from 60%. For workout, this earphone is great but if you are music enthusiasts like me, don't buy this earphone.",3
8131,"just got the headset. design and build is good in the very first look. my review is after the hands on. i will give detailed review after using it a week or two.
overall satisfied. bass is enough punchy. treble is good too. lets wait for build quality and connectivity review after few days.",5
8132,"Well it works better with smart phones but please don't put any expectations on other devices like laptop or bluetooth pods. Although battery performance is quite good.

Didn't work for me for even 1 year. Don't go for it.",2
8133,very good sound and good bass and battery runs whole day ..you have to charge it daily just like your smartphone,5
8134,"Very nice head phone , good build up quality, battery life is also good, bass of headphones are good quality overall nice headphones.",5
8135,Sound and built quality is awesome. One thing i didn't like about this product is the built design. The cord should have been placed not at the bottom but a little higher like most other bt earphones so that i would be easy to put it on while wearing a collar shirt.,5
8136,"Awesome product in this budget!! it compete Samsung level u, even much better then level u. Awesome sound quality, battery back up is also good !! So don't think & go for it, don't waste your money buying level u in extra price !!",4
8137,"Mic is on the right side, usually it comes in the left side. Battery backup is not as per specification. Other things are good n worth for the money.",4
8138,"I will talk only on negetive points. I have given 1 star less because of 2 reasons. 1) Bluetooth ranges is not so good. If u go out of the room to the adjacent room, the connectivity breaks, which was not in the case of Envent Bluetooth headphone which one also im using. Envent bluetooth headphones bluetooth connectivity is extremely good. 2) I like more booming bass so I bought this product, referring that it has Extra Bass, but this Bass is basic, not Extra Bass.",4
8139,I love the product. I took this product as I wanted to gift this headset to my friend. and she really loved it. thank you boat and Flipkart for this✌️,4
8140,"Highly recommend if bass is what you're looking for. However the sound quality is seriously compromised. Good for a workout, the earphones fit perfectly and noise cancellation is also great. A better sound quality would have made it an incredible product.",3
8141,"review after one month - built quality and sound quality is preety decent, not very great bass(if u r expecting). price wise its good got it under triple digit on Flipkart sell day. But only issue is that you can't expect it to run for more than 6hrs. and if u continue listening music through out the day expect it to run for not more than 4hrs max. otherwise great and i m using it.",4
8142,Awesome product. Well designed. Good battery backup. Nice gadget to use. I am loving it. Thanks to Boat.,5
8143,if you go for high bass sound it's good. But after sometimes you will don't like bass effect everytime. Go for vocal clarity so that voice calls and sound lyrics give you a good feeling.,4
8144,I am using this earphone and I would like to say this is really very good earphones... battery back up is good and sound quality is also good but the bass is not up to the mark,4
8145,"it's been about 5 months now using this product and it's good
sound quality is good
build quality is good
battery is not upto the expectation but overall it's a good product
if u are getting it for 999 buy it",4

Proses : 1.Fast Charging ( 30 min) enough for the day.

3. Back is good ( almost 70 calls per day)
4. Fast Connectivity. Max 5 sec.
Cons : 1. Battery dies immediately after low indication.
2. Design is not suitable for long duration ear fitting. starts aching.
3. Not suitable for running & workouts.
4. connectivity problem when mobile is in pocket.",3
8148,well it's been 1 week of using this product and it is undoubtedly the best at this price range.. bass is fantabulous overall a great product,5
8149,"bass is too much, if you don't like extra bass please don't go for it, everything is awesome, battery backup is enough, easily gives 4-5 hours, very light weight, i had used boat bassheads 220 wired headphone, compared to 220 this 255 have more bass...so think before buy whether you need super extra bass or not. if yes then you will love this one very much.",5
8150,"this product is in my hand is worth buying;
I got it fully charged and i played it continuously from 4;55pm and first time it indicated BATTERY LOW @11:49pm.....
Design is not that perfect but yeah no one gives a good design in this much of cost.
Sound quality and bass: it's all premium quality and it's activ NOISE CANCELATION, BASS is perfect...

But when both of them compared with Boat wired 225 and senheiser earphones- they are the beasts in delivering quality sound with minute notes clearly... So as far as my usage till now... can be purchased in this price range with good battery backup and good quality sound.... can go for it...

2) Good battery back up. but i feel that once it reached 60% it suddenly decreases.
3) Nice bass
4) Excellently comfortable to wear.U wont even know its there. its all i ever wanted.

Cons:

1) At high volume, the sound and bass becomes a little irritating.
2) Poor noise reduction.
3) When im hearing a song, if i sometimes touch the wire, the song breaks up.

So it could be improved",5
8252,"Nice product by boat .. sound is clear an sweet ,bass is perfect . Everything is okk but i'm facing some adjustment problem ,",4

8254,superb clarity exclusive products from boat is no1 brand super super super duper plllllllls purchase in prime day then price is 1300rs superb,4
8255,"Product is good according to description, sound qualities is appreciable at this price level. But no recommended for longer usage, after sometime it will start paining. Also in description pouch is mentioned, but no pouch is provided.",4
8256,Awesome product by boat sound quality and clearly is amazing such a nice product with flipkart fast delivery 👌👌👌😍😍,4
8257,It is not good for clear conversation.to talk any one other wise it is perfect without bass sound.,2
8258,"Lovely Bass,
voice while two wheels driving not clear but if use closed helmet okay.
Battery back up is good
some time it discount automatically and than it will connect",4
8259,good quality sound ... definitely go for it ... but who love music like hell .. don't go for it ... get wired earphones... Bluetooth earphones doest have that crisp sound which is in wired earphones... I have tried few Bluetooth earphones ... I didn't liked it at all,3
8260,totally Worth of money... superb bass clear sound quality and awesome look.,5
8261,"This earphone has brilliant bass and sound quality. It feels like listening on the headset. No issue in connectivity or anything like that.
battery backup is good around 10 hrs on standby or almost 5 hrs of music playback.

One concern is regarding the call quality. Its good in closed places but in outdoor calling voice is not that good for the recipient.
But, Overall a excellent Product when I bought for 999 in recent sale.",5
8262,Got it for 1299 . fast delivery. Good clarity of sound and Bass good. Value for money,4
8263,Nice one but one problem is about cellular call quality. The call quality is very poor. I couldn't hear something while calling. If your priority is listening music just go for it. Bass and trouble is very balanced and i heard music more than 2 hours continuously but didn't get any problem. If you are the person with lots of calling purpose never buy this u will regret. The battery is pretty decent i get more than 6 hours with mid volume.,4
8264,"voice is good but the battery is too less, it works for good 4 hours not more than that.. when a Bluetooth headset needs again and again charging, it certainly is not a good thing, should have taken the one with long battery.",2
8265,very nice Bluetooth headset...good bass good sound good calling and very good battery backup 😝,5
8266,"Good earphone at thik Price

8271,"Decent earphones, best in the price range ( I got it for 999)
Pros:
>good sound quality.
>fits perfectly.

Cons:
>There is a static sound when I connect it to laptop.(you get used to it)
>not the best for working out imo as it tends to fall of if you lying on your back.
>Unusual length for my liking.
>Bass is a bit too much for me. I have to use an equalizer to lower the low frequencies.
>Not suitable for competitive gaming as there is a slight but noticeable delay w...",4
8272,very easy to use and very comfortable with great sound quality and bass.. the only thing I noticed that at the full volume the high pich really hurts the ear but it is controllable just by lowering down the volume... so overall it's a good product in the market...,4
8273,"the bass is awesome
the mids are moderate
the sound is also very loud
it's fit on the ear perfectly
Cons:
no matter the quality of the sound is very good which the boat is known for
but the only issue is the build quality in the same price its competitors are providing a great build .
So in my opinion the build could been better",5
8274,Delivery is not satisfied it takes 4 days to come..and product quality is good but need more improvements in sound quality..But it is worth for that price..so I recommend that to buy this one because of low price and good sound as I satisfied with it.,4

8289,base is amazing and vocals are also pretty clear but problems are wire is not of good quality and too long as well. quality of neck band can be increased.,5

It has an awesome noise cancellation since they have included a earpiece to hold it to our ears.

every time loose in ear so comfort not well
battery backup excellent
sound quality good not excellent
i think it's normal wireless headfone not excellent
so don't expect more it's normal headfone
nothing special.

i got in 1300 rs but i think it's price high
i am disappointed it's comfort because it's loose in ear every time so don't buy this product

if you not prefer comfort then buy this otherwise don't buy this wireless headfone",3
8298,"amazing product, great experience by Flipkart, just another beautiful project to love.....(but only for bass lover, for better mids and high go to mi Bluetooth headset)",5
8299,Good sound quality. Very nice Bass. comfortable ear buds. Great for the price range. 4 Stars overall.,5
8300,"one of the better choices for budget Bluetooth earphones
Pros- 1) Sounds great
2) Decent build quality
3) Good battery backup (6-7 hours on a single charge.
Cons- 1) Could've been more comfortable (especially the eartips)
2) Bass output could've been more centralised to get more clear vocals.
Conclusion- If you're looking for something in this budget, I'd recommend these.
Hope this helps.",3
8301,"Genuine review. All is good. If you're looking for a better wireless earphone with quality of sound within the price range its a better option. After two weeks usage nothing bad about its performance. Only one And the main problem is, the fitting issue. its not comfortable to wear (ear pain, not fit under helmet). I don't know how to desctibe it 😡. Buy and use it you will know that.",3
8302,Its an amazing product at that price I have well satisfied with this product boat is awesome love it...✌️😘,5

Look and Feel :- simply super at its price range
Battery backup :- 6 hours to 7 hours
Bass:- 3/5 I would give
Weight :- less weight, some times you will feel it’s not around your neck.
Bluetooth Connectivity:- it does connect instantly when you turn your mobile Bluetooth ON. For quite a good distance it connects inspite of walls as disturbance in between. Though it disconnects or you may encounter distortion after you move away from the device, once you get back...",3
8305,"Boat Rockers Bluetooth headphones super
And then 1yr before not use users side returns this item",5
8306,"good product in this price segment.bass is not so deep but it's good..voice clarity n mic also works fine.
and mostly i like it's battery backup...it gives 8 hours of backup with music (not continuously) when you use it normally.",5
8307,"Fab in all aspects like calling, gaming, movies and listening songs. Battery backup is awesome. And that punchy bass, just loved it. I always personally recommend boat because they gives what they promise. Thumbs up for boat. ???",5
8308,It's good product . great sound quality ..fits perfectly around the neck ......I will give one more feedback after using this for few days.,5
8309,"Got this Boat Bluetooth earphones 2 days back. Delivery by Flipkart was super quick!

Coming to the product, it's an above average earphone for day to day purpose. Feel wise it's okay, not premium. The sound quality is also okay okay. Considering the price range, this product can be bought.
But if you are a die hard music lover and focus on very minute details of music then better to go with some other premium brand (which will cost you more obviously).",3
8310,"It is amazing.....Sound quality is good, Bass & treble is superb & design is very good but about to battery backup is little less 😬 actually battery backup also good in this amount 👍😁...",5
8311,A superb product from boat. Not at all disappointed with the product. The sound quality is crystal clear except for high tones and mid tones which is quite common in this price range. The bass is a bit lacking and can be adjusted with the equalizer. The build quality of the product is superior and the cable is made from Good quality rubber and is of flat type. The battery life of the headphones is spectacular. This would last somewhere from 7-8 hours with moderate usage and a bit low if the c...,5
8312,"it's a good product within this budget range, however it doesn't have noise cancelation option so not a great option to take calls when you are outdoor. The company needs to upgrade it. Also, the charging slot gets spoilt in few weeks/months because the delicate charging slot cover would break based on your frequent usage in some weeks/months from the time of purchase. The product is of no use when you can't charge it. I went through this bad experience with my first purchase. This is the sec...",3
8313,I have been using it for a week now battery backup is nice sound quality is ok but not soo good. If u r looking for a high bass earphone its good and built quality is also good but sometimes if the mic piece is not facing your mouth then the person other side cant hear my voice. So overall within this price its good,5
8314,"Nice product... Good base clear sound, Great battery life.. Value for money..",4
8315,value for money. sound is clear and you get hat stereophonic feel from left to right and right to left. bass is decent. but it's slightly distorted in full volume. so u keep your devices volume high. design is good and comfortable. u can use it for hours. I used it for 3 continuous hours without any discomfort. better than skullcandy and all.....,5
8316,"Aweeeeeeeesomeeee Product, My best choice, anyone looking for a great battery backup+ great Music effect + Great Design..... go for this one
I bought this for 1399/-",5
8317,"this product was brilliantly work body was asome and sound was clear heavy bass but smooth for years and noise cancellation have there and brilliantly work battery was actually good...

8320,They are great quality wise. also they do have a great bass.. sound clarity is Average.. but the thing impressed me the most is value for money..😎😎,4
8321,Because of Deep Bass sound clarity is little impacted. If you're looking for sound clarity then this might not be the your choice. I love deep bass hence its perfect fit for my choice and its worth for this price range. I got it for 999 during BSD sale. I would say go for it.,5
8322,Really nice product with great quality. Bought it during a sale in 1k. I AM HAPPY WITH THE PRICE AND QUALITY. What else do someone need. Sound is awesome and noise free. Looks very stylish and red and black looks insanely good.,5
8323,"Sound Quality - There is no quality to this kind of sound as it is heavily altered, fine for those looking for casual listening as there is not even little finesse. Bass- Too much bass, unnatural which in fact overshadows other frequencies, This headphone is good only for EDM tracks, rest of the music sounds Ok. Value for Money- Bought At a price of 1200 is good for outdoor jogging sessions, fits well. The websites are flooded with this range of earphones but If quality sound is what you ...",3

but i must say it's not so much confertable for jogging wire is to long and they not give any clip to adjust this wire 😠 this is very big problem...",4
8328,quality wise good and worth for 1.5k meanwhile sound is also good but bass is not that much expectation level,4

Bass is the highlight of boat rockerzz 255.design can be better but its acceptable battery looking good because I have used it only for two days. Must buy it. In a one word I will say PAISA VASOOL, but connectivity is not good",5
8337,"If your looking for a Bass heavy earphones then buy this & I guarantee you that you won't be disappointed. The bass is like it's coming from a Subwoofer & sometimes it's too much. When hearing some songs the Bass & Vocals are really balanced together but most of the time the Bass stands out more than the vocals.

Battery Backup is a beast. I have been continuously using these from yesterday when I got it for listening to Music & also a complete episode of Chernobyl TV series from the default ...",4

8360,"Almost perfect... The only thing I found little less than perfect is the length of the earpiece cords -a little bit longer than what could have been a perfect length. Apart from that, sound quality is good, loudness is also good -so when I am riding my motorcycle, I can hear the phone calls & also the navigation quite well. Price at 1500 is also not too bad... Overall 4.7 stars out of 5 to be perfectly honest... FlipKart -excellent as usual, all the best...",5

design is good
con is that Led light does not stop blinking during nights turns to be awful",4
8367,"Don't buy if you crave quality sound. I own a JBL t110 and a JBL t450 headphones which sounded much better go for wired earphones in sub 2k price for sound quality.

8382,"not good for gym person as the neck band doesn't stay fit while jogging and doing exercise because the size of this neck band is large and disturbs the sound quality because of thudding on collar bone while running.
sound quality and bass is above good but not best but considering the price point I bought this for RS 999 and sales after service of boat is also good
in case the product malfunction within the warranty period the company arranges the pickup and delivery for free if your locatio...",3
8383,"These earphones are best for Bass lovers in this price range. however, vocals are not as crispy as you can get in other premium earphones but overall the performance is good.
The best thing that I like about it is that it's very light weight so You can easily wear it for long hours and let's not forget that the CVC passive noise cancellation feature also works quite decent.
So if you're planning to buy any wireless budget earphones below 1500/ then you can consider it as a good option",4

8387,overall product is good.range is awesome it works well up to 10 meter. it can connect with two device at the same time. sometimes(or very few times) voice drop i felt. build quality is not up to the mark wires are thin. battery backup is good it runs upto 6-8 hrs. charging time is 1.5 hrs. sound quality is also good.i have not used much so if it works well for long time then it worth the money.,5
8388,"boat Rockerz 255F bluetooth Headset is very nice in because of its prize, it has a good quality sound and enough bass & trebal, but not that great for those who loves deep bass, cristal clear sound. It has a above good sound quality, but definitely not great. it is very easy to handle. very light weight, you can wear as long as possible and it is sound proof at highest volume level. You don't find any similar headset at this price. I bought it @999/-.",4
8389,"An amazing product by boat. Packing was safe and good. Coming to the sound quality, I'm an Mi user and when I connected it, the bass quality surprised me. it was fantastic. On the vocals and treble, it's slightly on a lower side but it balances out well. the battery backup is good in comparison. if you go to the next room with your phone on the other, you will get a few distortions. it's really comfortable on ear and even the noise cancellation is really good. overall I would rate this to be ...",5
8390,"Good Product at 999. Flipkart showed 1499/- but I waited and in two days it went down to 999/-. so guys wait for prices to drop. I am writing this review after using this product for 15 days. best buy at this price.

8396,"good buy within budget.. audio output is very loud.. the bass is thumping.. quality of audio is just managable.. build quality is good.. battery back up is more than one day.. not that comfortable to use..

overall good if you get it under 1000 bucks",3
8397,nice sound quality nd nice sound bass.thank you so much flipkart.ur delivery is too fast nd perfect time,5
8398,"product is good sound is good connectivity is good bass is also good comfort good ears does not pain but battery is worst if I charge for 100% it last for near by 2hours,if you listening to music or playing game but when it comes to 80% within 15min directly it goes to 20% then after that you can't expect boat rocker will be last more then 5min, very bad at battery backup or may be other reason but not satisfied with battery thank you",5
8399,"plz go with it very nice product with super bass, in my opinion it was come with good price single penny was worth o purchase this boat rockerz255 in 1500 was good and when lighting deal of flipkart i puchase in 999 so wait for good deal but it was excellent in 1500price point.. thank you",5

8403,best in price & highly recommend but if you are bass lover than you don't like bass is good but not very good bass rating i give is 4/5 i need very good deep bass,5
8404,It does nt have a range of 10 metre. Gets disconnected within 5 metres of range. Its bluetooth range is very weak. The packaging was also not good. the wires were protrudes out of its box and was sliding over rhw sharp edge of the inside box. Battery Back up is Just OK. Call quality is good. Overall a best buy for Rs. 999,5
8405,"As specified, this product gives a battery life of 5-6 hours, sound quality is also good, bass is significant, so this is better for bassheads. Those who want treble and high notes, this won't a good choice. Also the built quality is good, but it's plastic, like everything is plastic. Moreover, it's extremely light, so it won't even feel that you are wearing it. And, it has 1 year guarantee, this is something important, atleast to me. Overall, it's a good pair of earphones.",5

8416,"nice ups and downs.
sound quality is decent but boat bassheads 225 are better in terms of sound I think this is cause rockerz 255 is Bluetooth and bassheads 225 are wired.

overall impressed with sound and design,
and bass is punchy and doesn't irritates ears.

The earphones refused to work from one side on the 5th month from purchase but the company exchanged it for a new one the exchange process took about 3 weeks but I was satisfied with the service.",5
8417,"bought it at 999 RS at the sale ,pretty solid deal for under 1000 RS ,probably the best Bluetooth earphones under 1000
good bass
good sound quality
good battery backup (around 6hrs )
and good build quality",5
8418,built quality is too good sound quality is ok but as considering the price range. in short worth buying at price of 999 without a second thought go for it. Battery is amazing as compared to jbl mini duet headphones.,5
8419,Overall It's a good product but not best. Sound is very loud and bass is too much heigh which can even effect your ears so be careful with using it.I suggest to use a mobile equaliser or use it in low volume bcz in heigh volume it can harm your ear. Sweat proof features is really work I tested it in gym and also in water which is good for this price range.In medium volume can last upto 7-8 hrs. You can watch 3-4 movies easly. I got it in full charged and watch 3 movies and hear song for 1½ hr...,4
8420,"With 2 days of experience, I can paint rough image of what it is capable of. The build quality pretty good, the option for interchange ear-tips were cool. The sound quality, Great bass, medium high and mids making it apt for workouts and running. I got it for 999 and for that price, there's nothing that beat this. The connectivity was great so far and magnetic attachment of the buds make it look expensive though it has absolutely no functionality like oneplus bullets. But whom am I kidding...",5
8421,Awesome quality super solid sound overall great and good product,5
8422,"Good earphone,with good bass

Good product from boat,i looked up for neon colour but the price was not get reduced, that's why i bought black.

8423,product is not as gud as i expected build quality is decent bt d wire used for earphone is not of gud quality ...sound quality is average bass is gud at 70% of volume after dat sound distorts alot i comared it with mi sports earphone basic & those earphones sounds 200% better dan this one sound is crystal clear no distortion even at 100% volume & battery backup is also much better than dis one.....overall average product at this price it is gud to bye under 1k,3
8424,"Very good product, super sound quality and good battery backup 8 hours. Excellent",5
8425,clear sound of songs can't be hear something bass mixed thick voice ..noise cancellation during calling is not much effective ...battery backup is good. design is easy to use but to b care full ..neck strips should be more toughed and arched around neck ...I got this product in 999 so it's comparatively good.,4
8426,If u r Bass lover then definitely go for it... it gives a powerful bass and great sound impacts.Bass is really powerfull as i say than treble.Great packaging.. great quality with powerfull bass. Flipkart takes too long to deliver but boAt earphones refreshed the mood😊,5

8441,"At the discounted price of 999/- this is a very good product. Although my friend complains of the sound, I find it decent. The backup is around 5-6 hrs of continuous use. Gets full charged in 1:30-2:00 hrs. Connects very fast. If it's not connected and left 'on' it'll switch 'off' automatically after some time. While in call the person on the other end may hear the background noice very much clear.

Ear buds are so hard that you can't use them f even an hour straight. Also, while it works seamlessly on whatsapp audio and video calls, it does not work on regular network calls at all.
Later I found the reason for all these issues, when I tried to register the product on official website of Boat. My warra...",1

8575,i previously owned another version of hoat r9ckers and it was my all time favourite as i had lot of calls to pick with my job. Battery standby was awesome and it used to be clinging to my neck as chain always. I should say that this version of boat rockers has not cheated my expectation. i had been reviewing multiple products similar to this. The vest competent in this price range was Sony WI300. However the wire in it was very thin and easily breakable. Hence i chose this.,4

Pros:
1) The sound quality is equivalent to any of the normal/wired boAt earphones.
2) Bass is quite good.
3) Quite robust, I use them during gyming and they seem quite sweat proof. They are also able to withstand monsoon rains during my morning/evening runs outdoor.

9171,"First of all I am very new to the era of wireless headphones. This product is the entry segment with a minimum price.
Pro's : Music quality and bass is good. (Probably you are not expecting the one you get from Bose)
Connectivity is good . (Kudos to the qualcomm chipset)
There is no lag or delay or phase shift.
Built quality is also good.
But in a crowded place the speakers voice get dominated by the outside voice.
This is based on 2 days review.
Will upgrade after 1 month.",5
9172,the main problem it has is it doesn't have secondary noice cancelation mick. due to this problem it is only used for listening music. whenever I got call I have to switch off Bluetooth and talk with my phone.,3

9174,Superb,5
9175,Very nice product.,4

9178,Stops working after 30 days,1
9179,best quality,4
9180,The extra bass does not allow me customize setting in my music player equilizer. The Bass is good but for me.. it has limited my music dimensions to only high bass music may it party music or sad music. And I can't do anything about it...overall headphones are good. But would have been perfect if u could customize bass.,4
9181,good headphone,5
9182,The mic has stopped working after 4 months. It ain't sweat proof. The mic is terrible and the other party on the phone cannot hear anything. Not a good quality product. Even the battery back up ain't as advertised or great .,1

9431,"Headset is good in terms of build quality but the Bass is overpowering other sound profiles.
Bluetooth connectivity is not a issue untill one is in the vicinity of phone. otherwise flickering starts and further the sound will drop.
Mic is clear. To maintain quality, one need to be near phone.
Headset can connect with 2 device simultaneously which is really good.
Battery is great as of now (used around 2.5 hrs and still showing 80%)
Good for workouts for sure due to heavy bass, Ardent music ...",4

9436,Bass is low....so please avoid purchasing this product when you are a bass lover. Be sure before purchasing this product because once your order got delivered it will never get refunded and only get replaced if any part is defective or get broken or missing. So please be careful while ordering. I trapped in this and I am a bass lover but can't do anything....I also contact customer care but they are keep saying ' I am sorry sir'. It's a huge amount 1489 rupees.,3

9464,Great.I bought this in 1000 Rs and in this price range these are the best headset you can buy. Great for PUBG as well. These are the Bluetooth headset so little bit sound dealy but it doesn't make PUBG unplayable You get used to it.,5
9465,"sound quality is superb but battery backup is worst. as it claimed 6 hours of battery life, but it will only if u charge it on daily basis. otherwise battery backup is worst. when the battery level comes to 60%, it suddenly lowers to 20%.",2

9468,"fantastic product, but the range of 899 to 999 not at the range of 1499 don't go to buy it with the price they selling at the time wait for the sale, the quality of the product not likely with the price range of 1499 and more for the other colours.",5
9469,Battery backup is not good after 60% to 10 %battery down faster. On 100 % battery using after 30 mins battery showing 100% once its below 80 % battery down faster,5
9470,"Sound comes a fraction of sec late.. Mostly u will feel while playing pubg, shoot or click sound will come later..problem while keeping mobile in pocket throughout running.. Song cut in every sec.. I think when leg goes back while walking it cut music.. Connection comes intermittent.. Thats my experience in 2 days.",3
9471,"I had reced. delivery yesterday (04.08.2018) and after using for 12 hours continously...it is comfortable for neck nd ear, battery backup is also good..I had found this good so far...I had Samsung Level U too with me, but neck and ear started paining after 2-3 hrs.",5

9491,superb watch...,5
9492,The built quality of this headphone is the worst. I have used Sony and Philips headphones also. This is the worst of worst.

9555,"Very worst product, don't buy it",1
9556,Best headset if you get it for 1099 or less in what price i got it. The headset is comfortable if you use it around 1-1.5 hour but later it is a bit irritating to have it in your ears. The built quality is above average and once fully charged the battery lasts for about 7 hours of continuous use at 70% of volume. So if your budget is around 1200 and you are looking for a good headset for listening to bass only then go for it. Vocals are not as clear as expected but they do their job. Overall ...,4

10692,"Nice product, easy to install and easy to use as well. It improves the quality of the network by 40 to 50 %. Max 2 extenders can be used on 1 modem, more than will not work. Very low power consumption, Runs great with inverter.",4
10693,I agree with the review comments by Vishal Bedi. It doesn't serve what it promised as per the Dlink website.. The signal strength decreased to 2 point in the adjacent room itself. So single unit covering 2000 sqft stands impossible. Signal stability is good. WiFi roaming is upto the mark. I needed 2 covr unit to cover my 2 bhk house which was not my expectation. Signal coverage is below average.,3
10694,"Early review, so might update it later.
The initial impression is average. It is a good product, easy to set up, comes with a decent mobile app.
D-Link website advertises that a single point can easily cover 2000sq.ft. home and this is where the disappointment starts.
It is not able to cover an adjacent room 2000 sq.ft. is way off the charts.
Apart from that, it's a good product, with false promises. A decent upgrade to a regular dual-band router.

But don't get fooled by reading 5 star reviews which say it will give you optimum speed to your devices. i.e. In 40 MBPS plan, download speed will be 5 MBPS. It doesn't work in my case.

All the LED indicators are on the top (for keeping at table height), so if you are going to place it at a height on the wall, you won't be able to see the LED indicators (my case). In that case, one can go for Archer C20i AC750, which is same category vertical model with internal antennas....",5

I would not recommend this router to anyone. Mine did not work right from the moment I unpacked it. The Internet (WAN) port does not recognize live RJ-45 cable inserted at all. I had to borrow my friends WRT54G router to make sure that the router hardware was kaput and not my Internet line.

10889,very nic,5
10890,This is a very good product,5
10891,It is good for security reason but the range is similar to a two antenna router. Because the middle one is a 5 Ghz so either u can connect it or turn it off.

It's absolutely worth the money for a 3000 sq feet area with 1300 sq feet of constructed area.

10928,This Router is pretty average to be honest. I have a 150Mpbs and getting max speeds of 80-90Mbps in 5Ghz and 50-60Mbps in 2.4Ghz. I do not know about the range yet as I have routers for every room so never get to test the range.

It's really good product and I think I have purchased over a perfect product. Range of the signal is enough for me and it gives me superb signal whether I am in the room or I am in another floor.",5
10989,"Recommend it as this is a great router with a good range and can handle multiple devices with ease. It's been 4 months and I am completely satisfied with its performance. And as a cherry on top, it has a very user-friendly app to monitor its access and other settings.",5
10990,"For the price this is a decently good router with single band four antina router. I have a 60mbps lan connection and its works great , also the range is also very good. Using its about a month now its good ✌️",4
10991,"it's range is much less compared to mi 3c
positives
1. latest features according to latest developments in wireless technology.
2. it has 3 modes wireless LAN , wireless repeater and access point , since this is my second router in the house and I am not a fan of repeater i am using in access point mode.
3. Good design aesthetic wise.
negatives
1.No 5ghz AC mode support however at this price only iBall provides it.
2. Range is a big issue 3 antennas seems to be for show purpose mi 3c gives ...",4
10992,Great nice products...it has good range with 3 antenna... compared to market price..I got 970/-....it's good deal.... thanks Flipkart..,5
10993,"Initial impression is great. I don't know why people is complaining about range. This thing got exceptional wifi range, the signal is also super stable. Just place it somewhere high also keep away from walls and metals. App is just for the name, only basic stuffs in app. Wifi recieving and transmission power is very good. 5 stars for it. Let's see how well it goes. Will definitely update in future if anything goes wrong. Packing was below avarage, came in its own carton. No proper packing was...",5
10994,The range is good but the problem is speed decreased when i compare with my dlink single antenna router and ping is also too high like 80-120 so for mobile and pc gaming iwont prefer it . Add some money and buy good one,3
10995,"very good wifi. I'm using this one as a range extender and is working fine for me.

you can easily connect it with your existing wifi router and place it within range of the existing wifi. You just need to follow the steps as per manual for installing as a range extender.

Very happy with the product, mostly with the range extender mode.",5
10996,Not great product at all. My single antina router is doing better or almost the same. Expected better range .,1
10997,"AMAZING PRODUCT RANGE IS QUITE GOOD AND THE PRICE IS ALSO LOW IF YOU GO TO MARKET FOR BUYING THIS IT WILL COST MORE THAN 3000 RUPPES .......
ABOUT THE SPECIFICATION :-

TOTALLY IT HAS 5 ETHERNET CABLE PORT

IN THE BOX IT HAS THE ROUTER,RJ45

IT HAS THREE ANTEENA.

IF YOU WANT ONLINE GAMING AT AT A LOW COST IT IS GOOD FOR YOU.

IT IS BETTER AT HD STREEMING

11535,Super fast router. You just need to connect it with a stable broadband service according to the availability in your area. Mine is Alliance broadband FTTH and I'm using just the starter package with 60Mbps. But Look what I'm getting wired/wireless both! 🤑🤓,5
11536,"The router is easy to setup, have basic parental control and good coverage on 2.4ghz band. Overall I am happy with the product however at this price range they should have added
a. USB support for FTP devices
b. Advance parental controls (only schedule and website (allow or deny) can be applied for all devices. You can't set the control for each device, it will be applied to all devices selected for parental controls. Moreover the web site either could be allowed or disallowed)",4
11537,"Awesome product . Easy setup even for new users .

One important Note that this router is Version 3 , It has 4 x 6dbi antennas and power adapter DC output is 9V 1A .

On 2.4 Range is Awesome nearly double from N150 Router ( Previous Router i used was Tenda W316R) . 5 Ghz range is less .

No connection drop . Currently my ISP is Alliance Broadband , 50Mbps Up and Down .

Go for it .",5

11543,Not satisfied. Speed is going up and down continuously. Some time disconnects automatically. Price is also very high than other routes. I raised a complaint regarding the problems facing with this product. A technician visit was scheduled by Flipkart. But the technician did not come and phoned me and asked me for some photos of the router on WhatsApp and closed my issue without any house visit. Now I called Flipkart again and informed him about the same. Customer service is very bad and is no...,2

Would give this a 3/5
Pros:
Build quality is really good
2Ghz speed is nice
Smooth app interface too

5Ghz range is bad
Not worth paying the price rather go for Dlink 1200mbps it gives around 200mbps speed clearly with no lag.

11866,This range extender work fine to extend range but it will reduce your internet speed to half of what you get when you connect to original router. Also faced disconnection issue with extender even after router working fine. It doesn’t have rj45 connectivity as its just extender. Suggest you to go for tp link or d link or netgear extender. It costs you more but give more feature as well as better quality,3
11867,Great Product... I have a TP-Link Router which is a good product but although I have no range issue in Ground Floor when it comes to First Floor my Signal is very weak and I am unable to Watch videos only browsing is possible. I brought this extender and plugged into a socket just above the stair case and the signal reception is great and I have no problems anymore. With speed tests I get the same speed as my internet connection too. Value for money and good solution.,5

11882,Best router at this price range. It's very compact and lightweight. Though it's wi-fi range is not of some 4 antenna router still it's pretty good compared to other routers at this price range.,5
11883,"The product is a really good product from Mi as it doesn't take much time to setup and minimum technical skill would be required to set this thing up...it is also easy to use by tha app and gives you full control over the device. A smart router in true sense.

Now after this why have I gave this 2 star...simple only one reason the packaging that I have got today and about this I won't write in details over here but rather I am sharing 2 photos which will be enough",2
11884,"Best Router in this segment...Go for it 👍
Better than other brands like TP Link or D-Link.
This router has various features and attractive sleek design with matte looks which wins your heart at first look.
And 4 high gain antennas are outstanding...It covers my 3 BHK easily.
Easy to use and beat thing is that you can easily access this from your phone... loaded with features.

In layman language...This router easily sync with your day-to-day life.

Thanks.",5

It's an amazing product which is having 4 antennas for giving a wider range of connectivity.And it is an absolute SMART ROUTER which has the option of getting the details of all the connected devices.You can also set the daily data quota which will save your data if you are having a limited data plan from your ISP.

You can additionally connect up to 64 devices at a time without losing any speed.

11890,4 antennas do not actually make any difference in reality..router is good but quality of signal gets generated in not that strong...when it comes to penetrate 3 walls it failed to show the power..works better with mi devices like phones or laptop compares to others...does not have a signal quality selector like only n or b/g/n,3
11891,Its a superb router to have......but remember one thing dont purchase this router by looking into the 4 antennas...!! Its a router worthy of range what u get from 2 antennas only.

4) delay in notifications sometimes",1
12319,Watch is in beta. The health app from oneplus comes with various promises of adding features in future. Everything is good until now in this watch except the weather report which I think is due to the beta part of the software. The battery is good with a very rough use I was able to kill it in 8 days.

12504,"When I tried to find Spo2 levels successively two times the watch is sometimes giving varied values . I checked with a standard pulse oxymeter the readings are also differing with the watch readings by 2 or 3 percentage. The OnePlus has to fine tune the Spo2 software. Another lacunae is when the cellphone is having two sim cards and are in active state , it is not possible to dial a cellphone number through a smartwatch. The software has to be upgraded.",4

Dial design is amazing.
But oneplus messed up the belt , the should have gone with the ordinary belt .

In the same price range, alot of other watches will get the job done. Go for it if you are a OnePlus fan, and believe in the phrase ""what's coming is better than what has gone"".

12761,"My First Apple Watch!!! Simply Amazing.
I used to wear China smartwatch earlier but I never felt anything like what I feel after wearing Apple Watch. It’s original and superb.
The heart rate monitor is super accurate.
Best part is that you simply can access all your notifications in your apple watch which means you don’t need to remove your cell from pocket again and again. You can reply to any messages in your watch itself and also it shows suggestions of auto replies which I feel is best....",5

coming to packing never expected from flipkart they sent product like...",5

12781,"Upgraded to this from a Series 2, so along with this review I thought I’d do a comparison between them for those of you confused about which one to get.

First off, both the Series 2 and Series 3 are identical, looks wise. Since we’re not getting the LTE model of the Series 3 (which feature the red dot on the Digital Crown) in India because of lack of supporting cellular infrastructure, we have the GPS models only. That said, the Series 3 GPS has a composite (plastic) back instead of the supe...",5

Thank you flipkart fo this wonderful product..",4
12783,One of best investments I made. Considering I bought in big billion day sale. It has good battery life of 2.5 days with gps turned off. Excellent tracker with precise heart beat calculation. Tried comparing with my treadmill data. Precise calculation of steps. Love everything about it. Must buy if u r in the Apple ECOSYSTEM. Buy a stainless steel strap for classy look.,5

12785,"I won’t deny that I had my doubts about purchasing a smart watch online. However, since the series 3 isn’t available in stores anymore and my budget constraint, I ordered it with fingers crossed. It’s been 2 days. It works like a charm. However battery life could have been better lasts one day. Definitely value for money.",5
12786,apple watch is a top of the line smartwatch you can ever buy....no other watches in this segment cant be even compared with this...the display and the quality is top notch...if you want to use it to the fullest u better have an iPhone....,5

12814,"Great service delivery by Flipkart. Received it as advertised.

The watch itself works like a charm. Super fluid user experience without any lag whatsoever. Inbuilt speakers, waterproofing and gps are big plus points. Keep in mind that you will need a bluetooth earphone to be able to stream music without your iPhone, or else a Bluetooth speaker.

Overall, totally recommened and worth the premium price as it beats whatever little competition is out there for smartwatches.",5

12846,Good as a watch but not as good as smartwatch because it has limit. works only with IOS which is not good at all. I have samsung gear s3 which works with IOS and android both also much cheaper than this. so my honest opinion as a watch 4 star but as a smartwatch 2 star.,4

I used to wear China smartwatch earlier but I never felt anything like what I feel after wearing Apple Watch. It’s original and superb.
The heart rate monitor is super accurate.

First off, both the Series 2 and Series 3 are identical, looks wise. Since we’re not getting the LTE model of the Series 3 (which feature the red dot on the Digital Crown) in India because of lack of supporting cellular infrastructure, we have the GPS models only. That said, the Series 3 GPS has a composite (plastic) back instead of the supe...",5

Since the print quality was really good, I purchased Kodak photo sheets and print few nice family photos too. I couldn't comment about the number of sheets per cartridge since the product is new. I have printed 300+ sheets so far and black ink level is at just below to half. Printing from mobile (Wifi) is really easy.",5
13729,"The printer arrived in plastic wraps with the Epson carton visible. The plastic wraps were torn at the edges. It was raining at the time of the delivery, so some water seeped into the carton and it had obvious wet patches. There was no visible dampness to the product. However, upon opening the plastic cover, the glass scanner surface was frosty. Evidently, the product deserves a much better protective packing.

The printer felt considerably lighter than expected. The build quality seems frail...",4
13730,It is nice and light weight printer with easy installation. It has multiple modes to print photos like standard and high quality. Refilling of printer is also quite simple and doesn't require expertise. Epson customer care is also very supportive in installation and demo. I got same day delivery and installation.

Cons:

14459,"Hi Shoppers, I have got HP LaserJet M1005 Monochrome Multifunction Printer and used it, Here is my review on it.

The printer is as big as it’s name, and its got a truckload of features. You can print, scan & copy with this machine (almost all MFPs do this, by the way. So the features aren’t actually a ‘truckload’). It does pretty much everything required that is related to your basic printing needs.

14736,Printer is very good for home use. It is light and is easy to set up and operate. ONLY DRAWBACK IS THE COST OF COMPATIBLE CARTRIDGE HP 803 which is very expensive.

14778,Awesome Camera. But lens is not good. Buy sigma lens for this camera. If you are looking for cheaper prime lens (blurry background) buy neewer 35mm f1.7 emount lens. It is manual focus lens. But sharp and good.,5

14783,"I bought it on 26 March and now after one week writing this review.

I am happy with the image quality with the kit lens but it can be upgraded if you use another better ""Prime"" lens from Sigma or Zeiss lens.
The video quality is not that good in low light but if you are filming in good lighting condition, It will work awesome.
Continuous focus is good but in low light, it searches for the object too much.",5
14784,"its battery charge isn't good, but you can keep extra batteries, otherwise it's good as any good dslr. It is more handy than dslr because it is light weighted and you can easily carry it in your pocket unlike dslr. Worth one!!! M quite happy with dis one :)",5

The camera has a good grip and is comfortable for holding. The performance is lowlight is much better than I expected. The navigation and buttons are user friendly.

16398,"Friends, plz don't check on the negetive comments. The product what we are getting at this price is more than sufficient. Getting perfectly synchronised with iPhone and as well as Android. We cannot expect something equivalent to an an Apple watch at this price. The watch may not be super big one in size, but if u have a moderate physique, it will definitely worth buying. The heart rate monitor is not accurate, which hardly matters to me, since I'm not a heart patient. The speaker is ok, not ...",4
